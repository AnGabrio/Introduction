# About me
My main research areas include Bayesian methodology, Bayesian parametric and nonparametric modelling, health economic evaluations, decision models, methods for handling missing data, meta-analysis and survival analysis.

# Code
Some Bayesian software code used to implement the models in my projects
* [STAN code](https://github.com/AnGabrio/Code/tree/master/partitioned%20survival%20CUA) for modelling of structural values in patient level partitioned survival cost utility analysis 
* [JAGS code](https://github.com/AnGabrio/Code/tree/master/joint%20longitudinal%20models) for joint longitudinal models in economic evaluations when dealing with missing data
* [JAGS code](https://github.com/AnGabrio/Code/tree/master/volleyball) for joint model of volleyball match results 
* [JAGS code](https://github.com/AnGabrio/Code/tree/master/structural%20ones) for bivariate Beta-Gamma missing data model with an hurdle approach to handle structural ones in the effectiveness  
* [JAGS code](https://github.com/AnGabrio/Code/tree/master/longitudinal%20model) for longitudinal bivariate Beta-LogNormal pattern mixture model with an hurdle approach to handle structural ones and zeros in the effectiveness and costs 
* Some tutorials on writing and fitting Bayesian models using R and [JAGS, OpenBUGS or STAN](https://agabrioblog.onrender.com/tutorial/)
* [MissingHE](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/) R package to fit different types of Bayesian models for handling missing data in health economic evaluations
